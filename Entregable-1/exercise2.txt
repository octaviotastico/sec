In this exercise we used hashcat and a lot of dictionaries to try to crack the password.
We created a python script to use hashcat. Hashcat hashes a password, and then compares
the hash with the given one (the password we're trying to guess).
We didn't found anythin, but we algo tried with John (it's the same as hashcat, but it's
optimized better for the CPU, whereas Hashcat is optimized better for the GPU).
